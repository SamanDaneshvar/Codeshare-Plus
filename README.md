# Codeshare Plus
A bridge between the Codeshare.io interface and the programming interpreter installed on your computer.

## What is Codeshare.io?
*Codeshare.io* is an impressive online code editor that enables you to collaborate with others in real-time, using only a share link.

## Why you need Codeshare Plus
Unfortunately, Codeshare lacks one important feature: Running code. It does not have any interpreters/compilers, and only focuses on the code editing capability.

**Codeshare Plus** is a small Windows utility that adds this capability to Codeshare. Anytime you press the *F10* key in Codeshare, this utility collects your code and runs it in the programming interpreter on your system (default is Python).

Basically, *Codeshare Plus* acts as a bridge between the Codeshare.io interface (open in your web browser) and the programming interpreter installed on your computer. The app defaults to the Python interpreter, but you can change this to any interpreter in the settings.
